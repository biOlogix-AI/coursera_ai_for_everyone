Week 1 (What is AI?) - 1. Introduction


About the course:
	* Non-technical course.
	* Explain buzzwords.
	* How to use AI personal context, corporation or organization?
	* AI's affect on society.

	* First week:
		* Cut through the hype and give realistic view of AI.
		* What is AI?
		* Machine learning.
		* Data and what types of data are valuable and what are not valuable.
		* What makes a AI first company, improve your company or organizations ability to use AI.
		* What ML can and cannot do?

	* Second week:
		* AI technologies can be used to build valuable projects. 
		* What it takes to build AI projects?
		* What it feels like to build an AI project?
		* How to select projects that are technically feasible and valuable to you, business or organization?
		
	* Third week:
		* Build AI in company.
		* Steps for making company good at AI.
		* AI transformation playbook.
		* Build AI teams and complex AI products.
		* AI's huge impact on society.

	* Fourth week:
		* Diminish or eliminate biases in AI systems.
		* AI's affect on developing economies.
		* AI's affect on jobs.
		* Navigate rise of AI for yourself and for organization.


AI market:
	* McKinsey Global Institute, AI is estimated to create an additional 13 trillion US dollars of value annually by the year 2030. 
	* Value into software industry is known.
	* AI has also affect outside software industry in sectors such as retail, travel, transportation, automotive, materials, manufacturing, and so on.


AI reality check:
	* Society, newspapers and research papers tend to talk about success stories of ML and AI and not failure stories because they aren't interesting.
	* Discuss examples of both to get a realistic view of what AI and what ML can or cannot do.
	* Gain judgements about what problems may or may not be solved using these technologies.


Types of AI
	* There is a lot of excitement but also lot of unnecessary hype about AI.
	* AI is actually two separate ideas. 
	* Artificial narrow intelligence.
		* Do one thing
			* Smart speaker.
			* self-driving car.
			* AI to do web search.
			* AI applications in farming or in factory. 
		* one trick ponies but can be incredibly valuable. 
	* AGI (artificial general intelligence.)
		* Building AGI is the goal of AI.
		* can do anything a human can do or maybe even be superintelligence and do even more things than any human can.
	* Tons of progress in ANI and but almost no progress in AGI.
	* Rapid progress in ANI has caused people to conclude that there's also a lot of progress in AGI this causes people to have irrational fears about evil clever robots coming over to take over humanity. 
	* AGI is an exciting goal for researchers, but to get there technological breakthroughs are needed and it may take decades to thousands of years.


Deep Learning:
	* Recent rise of ML has been driven through Deep Learning, sometimes also called Neural Networks. 
	* Explanation of deep learning to better understand what they can do particularly for a set of narrow ANI tasks.


Course takeaway:
	* Gain knowledge and understanding of AI technology better than company leadership or senior roles.
	* Ability to help yourself or company or organization navigate the rise of AI.
	* Be in position to provide leadership to others.

Week 1 (What is AI?) - 2. Machine Learning


Supervised Learning:
	* Most commonly used type of machine learning.
	* Learns input to output mappings (A -> B)
	* It may seem limiting, but for a right scenario, this can be incredibly valuable. 
	* Examples:
		* Spam Filtering - email (input A) -> email spam or not, 0/1 (output B).
		* Speech recognition - audio clip (input A) -> generate text transcript (output B).
		* Machine translation - English (input A) -> different language (output B).
		* Online advertising - information about ad + user (input A) -> user click on the ad or not (output B)
			* Show ad most likely to be clicked.
			* Huge economic impact and is very lucrative.
		* Self-driving car - image + information from radar + other sensors -> position of other cars (output B) to avoid the other cars. 
		* Visual inspection - picture of object manufactured on assembly line, like cell phone  (input A) -> find if scratch, or dent is present (output B)
			* Visual inspection helping manufacturers to reduce or prevent defects 


Why is supervised learning taking off now?
	* The idea of supervised learning has been around for many decades.
	* But it's really has taken off recently due to the rise of ML techniques like Neural Networks and Deep Learning.  
	* Let's look at below plot
		* Horizontal axis - amount of data.
			ex: for speech recognition, this can be audio and transcripts.
		* Vertical axis  - performance of AI system.

	* Traditional AI system
		* Feeding data gets the performance bit better.
		* But, Beyond certain point it does not get much better even if more data is fed.
			* ex: speech recognition system or online advertising system accuracy did not get better

	* Modern AI (NN & DL)
		* If a small neural network is trained, then the performance increases as you feed them more data for much longer than traditional AI.
		* If a medium-sized neural network is rained, then the performance increases much longer as more data is fed.
		* If a large neural network is trained, then the performance just keeps on getting better and better.
			* Helps to create high-performance and highly accurate systems which have applications in speech recognition, online advertising, self-driving car 
			* Products become more acceptable to users and valuable to companies.

	                          AMOUNT OF DATA



Requirements for high performance in modern AI:
	* Lot of data enables the model to work really well
		* Amount of data you accessible has increased due to rise of the computers and Internet.
		* Data which used to stay in pieces of paper are now digitised.
		* Importance of big data has increased.
	* Fast Computers 
		* Faster processors as per Moore's law and specialized processors such as graphics processing units (GPU)
		* Helps in training large neural network. 
		* Enabled even smaller companies to be able to train large neural nets on large data to get good performance which generates business value.
